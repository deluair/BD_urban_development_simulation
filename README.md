# Bangladesh Urban Development Simulation (2025-2035)

## Overview

This project simulates the complex dynamics of urban development in Bangladesh for the period 2025-2035. It aims to model the interplay between various urban systems to project growth, livability, sustainability, and resilience under different potential scenarios.

The simulation currently uses synthetic data and simplified interaction logic as a foundational framework based on a detailed prompt outlining the desired components.

## Core Components Simulated

The simulation is structured modularly, with each major component handled by a separate class:

1.  `UrbanGrowthModel`: Population dynamics, basic land use changes.
2.  `UrbanHousingModel`: Housing stock (formal/informal), prices, affordability.
3.  `UrbanInfrastructureModel`: Water, sanitation, power, waste, internet coverage/reliability.
4.  `UrbanTransportModel`: Commute times, modal split, road density, transit coverage.
5.  `UrbanEconomyModel`: GDP per capita, unemployment, sectoral shifts, informal economy share.
6.  `UrbanGovernanceModel`: Municipal revenue, citizen satisfaction, planning compliance.
7.  `UrbanEnvironmentModel`: Air quality (AQI), green space ratio, recycling rate.
8.  `UrbanSocialModel`: Literacy, healthcare access, social cohesion, crime rate.
9.  `UrbanRuralLinkageModel`: Migration rates, commuter percentages.
10. `UrbanServiceModel`: Provision of schools, healthcare (beds), public space.
11. `SmartCityModel`: Digital literacy, e-service adoption, IoT density.
12. `UrbanResilienceModel`: Early warning coverage, building code compliance, disaster recovery speed.

*   **Component Files (`urban_*.py`):** Each file contains the Python class responsible for simulating a specific urban subsystem.
*   **`main_simulation.py`:** Contains the main simulation loop, data handling (`UrbanDataHandler`), analysis/reporting (`UrbanAnalysisEngine`), configuration generation, and the execution entry point.
*   **`simulation_outputs/`:** This directory is created automatically to store the output plots and HTML reports generated by the `UrbanAnalysisEngine`.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  **Libraries:** Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

## Running the Simulation

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the main script:

```bash
python main_simulation.py
```

This will:
1.  Initialize all simulation components using the synthetic configuration data.
2.  Run the simulation year by year from 2025 to 2034 (10 years default).
3.  Print updates for each simulation step to the console.
4.  Generate outputs in the `simulation_outputs` directory.

## Outputs

After a successful run, the following outputs will be available in the `simulation_outputs` directory:

*   **`key_indicators_plot.png`:** A plot showing the trends of key indicators (e.g., Population, AQI, Affordability, Satisfaction) over the simulation period for the major cities.
*   **`simulation_report.html`:** An HTML report summarizing the initial (2025) and final (2034) state of various indicators for key cities, including percentage changes. It also embeds the generated plot.

## Current Status & Limitations

*   **Synthetic Data:** The simulation currently relies on placeholder synthetic data defined in `main_simulation.py`. Real-world data integration is needed for meaningful results.
*   **Simplified Logic:** The interaction logic within and between models is highly simplified (often using random factors or basic linear relationships). Much more detailed algorithms based on urban science principles and Bangladesh-specific contexts are required.
*   **Limited Scope:** Many detailed aspects mentioned in the initial prompt (e.g., specific spatial dynamics, agent-based modeling, policy scenario testing) are not yet implemented.

## Future Work

*   Integrate real data sources (BBS, RAJUK, LGED, etc.).
*   Develop more sophisticated algorithms for each component model based on urban theories and empirical evidence from Bangladesh.
*   Implement spatial modeling techniques (e.g., Cellular Automata, GIS integration).
*   Incorporate Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) for individual behaviors (housing choice, transport mode choice).
*   Develop scenario management capabilities to test different policy interventions.
*   Enhance visualization and reporting.
